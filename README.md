## Current plans
* Specialized interpreter for my current Google Sheet
* Generalized "med sheet" creator
* Interface for updating the "med sheet"
* A mobile app that updates sheets through Python Sheets API
## What I had to install to make this run
**gspread**
```pip install gspread```
**Google OAuth2Client (I actually don't remember if it's part of the project but I will never forget trying to install it 15 times)**
I have absolutely no idea how I managed to accomplish (assuming that at some point I did) the installation of these wretched objects. The installation process and errors I've encountered appear more inaccessible than convolutions of Polish law systems from the perspective of a simple farmer that's never had to look up the meaning of words such as "promulgacja" in their life before.
